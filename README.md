Firebase and the Final Product
Continue developing the application started in Week 5.  You need to make sure that you create and add a Firebase database to your application. Your app should access at least 3 items from a Firebase database.

Create a final report for your application. The final report should include the preliminary work you did in week 5, like the intent of the application, intended users, market, competitive features, etc. You should have a section describing the overall operation of the app with a link to the Git repository, how the Cordova plugin was used, and what items were retrieved from the database. Another section should describe the testing you performed.


Using TypeScript and Angular I was asign to develop an app.

The app I created is a freelancer app called Employ.

The code provided derived from the src folder.
